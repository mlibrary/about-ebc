  Although numerous disciplines recognize multiple ways of conceptualizing time,
  Stefan Tanaka argues that scholars still overwhelmingly operate on
  chronological and linear Newtonian or classical time that emerged during the
  Enlightenment. This short, approachable book implores the humanities and
  humanistic social sciences to actively embrace the richness of different times
  that are evident in non-modern societies and have become common in several
  scientific fields throughout the twentieth century. Tanaka first offers a
  history of chronology by showing how the social structures built on clocks and
  calendars gained material expression. Tanaka then proposes that we can move
  away from this chronology by considering how contemporary scientific
  understandings of time might be adapted to reconceive the present and pasts.
  This opens up a conversation that allows for the possibility of other ways to
  know about and re-present pasts. A multiplicity of times will help us broaden
  the historical horizon by embracing the heterogeneity of our lives and world
  via rethinking the complex interaction between stability, repetition, and
  change. This history without chronology also allows for incorporating the
  affordances of digital media.
