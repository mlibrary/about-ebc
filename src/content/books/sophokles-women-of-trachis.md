description: >-
  This new translation of Sophoklesâ€™ Women of Trachis is a living script in
  conversation with the past. Rachel Kitzinger, a Classicist, and Eamon Grennan,
  a poet, have captured the tones of ancient Greek in strong, swift English,
  making this translation suitable for a modern audience, whether as readers,
  listeners, or viewers. The unique addition of an audio recording of the text
  performed by Vassar College students contributes to the play's accessibility
  and vividness. Offering a picture both of domestic life and of the values and
  expectations that characterize Athenian men, Women of Trachis is a rich
  resource for those interested in gender roles in Greek antiquity.
