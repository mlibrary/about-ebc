description: >-
  This book offers a lived defense of liberal education. How does a college
  professor, on a daily basis, help students feel the value of liberal education
  and get the most from that education? We answer this question, as professors,
  each day in the classroom. John William Miller, a philosophy professor at
  Williams College from 1924-1960 and someone noted for his exceptional
  teaching, developed one form that this lived defense can take.
