description: >-
  In a life full of chaos and travel, Elizabeth Bishop managed to preserve and
  even partially catalog, a large collection—more than 3,500 pages of drafts of
  poems and prose, notebooks, memorabilia, artwork, hundreds of letters to major
  poets and writers, and thousands of books—now housed at Vassar College.
  Informed by archival theory and practice, as well as a deep appreciation of
  Bishop’s poetics, the collection charts new territory for teaching and reading
  American poetry at the intersection of the institutional archive, literary
  study, the liberal arts college, and the digital humanities.
