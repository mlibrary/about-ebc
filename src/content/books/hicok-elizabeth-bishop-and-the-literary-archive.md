  In a life full of chaos and travel, Elizabeth Bishop managed to preserve and
  even partially catalog, a large collection—more than 3,500 pages of drafts of
  poems and prose, notebooks, memorabilia, artwork, hundreds of letters to major
  poets and writers, and thousands of books—now housed at Vassar College.
