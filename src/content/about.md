## How we run Lever Press

Unlike other Open Access initiatives, Lever Press is a press governed by its participating members. An Editorial Board, composed of faculty from participating institutions, oversees the editorial and review process for our titles; an elected Oversight Committee, composed of representatives of participating institutions, directs the execution of Lever’s business plan.



## Editorial Board

The Editorial Board is responsible for overseeing the acquisition, review, and development process through which individual titles have progressed, and to assure by its imprimatur both the scholarly quality of a work and its alignment with the editorial program of the Lever Press. The Board consists of faculty nominated from Lever Press pledging institutions and selected by the Oversight Committee. The Chair of the Oversight Committee holds an ex officio position on the Board and two representatives from Michigan Publishing and Amherst College Press hold non-voting positions. The Board meets monthly by teleconference and in person at least once per year.

**Current Editorial Board members:**

* Phyllis Brown, Santa Clara University
* Mary Crone-Odekon, Skidmore College (Vice Chair)
* Darin Hayton, Haverford College (Chair)
* Katherine Hite, Vassar College
* Karil Kucera, St. Olaf College
* Jason Mittell, Middlebury College
* Brett Rogers, University of Puget Sound
* Lisa Trivedi, Hamilton College
* Josephine Wright, College of Wooster

**Standing**

## Oversight Committee

The Oversight Committee is responsible for overall strategic guidance of the Lever Press. The Committee consists of representatives nominated from and elected by Lever Press pledging institutions, and two representatives from Amherst College Press and Michigan Publishing. The committee meets monthly by teleconference and in person at least once per year.

## Operations Group

The Lever Press Operations Group is essentially the production backbone of Lever Press. It consists of staff at Amherst College Press and Michigan Publishing with a key role in acquiring, developing, and producing Lever Press titles, or in the administration of this initiative. The current Operations Group consists of:

* Beth Bouloukos, Director, Amherst College Press and Lever Press
* Hannah Brooks-Motl, Assistant Acquisitions Editor, Lever Press
* Jason Colman, Director, Michigan Publishing Services
* Elizabeth Demers, Editorial Director, University of Michigan Press

## Our Values

Lever Press is **grounded on a set of values**, and **guided by clear commitments**. The values on which we’re basing our work are:

* producing the highest quality scholarship in an economically sustainable model
* embodying and reflecting the values of the liberal arts, and
* leading the way in establishing best practices for born-digital, peer reviewed, open access monograph publishing.

As a press aligned with the ethos and mission of liberal arts colleges, we seek out, identify, evaluate, and advocate for transformative scholarship that spurs creative dialogue within and between traditional fields of inquiry, emphasizes disciplinary innovation, draws upon new models of collaborative research, and strives to reach the broadest audience possible. We value:

* leadership and the courage to push existing boundaries
* diverse voices and viewpoints
* the principles of equity and social justice
* building community among our members and beyond
* continuous learning

By living our values we will be responsive to the needs of readers, authors, and member institutions, share our liberal arts focus broadly, and engage globally with others in the exchange of new scholarship.

## Our Commitments

_**Alignment with mission and ethos of liberal arts colleges**_. Like the colleges supporting our mission, we welcome works exploring intellectual connections across academic disciplines and divisions. Lever Press also champions works whose methods and modalities reach beyond the standard 100,000-word monograph. Inspired by the close collaborations between faculty and undergraduate students at liberal arts colleges, we seek path-breaking ideas communicated with clarity and creativity—publications that “teach what they know.”

_**Platinum Open Access**_. Lever Press is a fully open access press: all works will be freely available to readers on the web immediately upon publication. Uniquely, Lever Press is committed to what we’re calling “Platinum OA,” in which all the costs of acquiring, editing, developing, and producing the work are borne collectively by our supporting institutions—not by individual authors or their sponsoring departments or institutions. Platinum OA means the Lever Press can consider works with regard to scholarly merit only. But because we take on all the costs of producing the work we select, Platinum OA means one thing  more: that the work we produce is of the highest quality, and has been selected exactly because it is worth investing in.

_**Digitally native**_. While Lever Press titles will appear in print form wherever possible, we approach publishing as a digital-first endeavor. Unconstrained by legacy publishing processes and leveraging the opportunities for reuse facilitated by an open-access business model, Lever Press will welcome projects of digital scholarship not well served by scholarly conventions limited to print-only outcomes. We’ll work in partnership with an emerging community of scholars in the digital humanities who are linking together narrative analysis and datasets from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and using new tools for visualization and reader engagement.

## Historical Documents

The Lever Press arises out of an initiative of the Oberlin Group to study how the libraries of liberal arts colleges could offer a new and compelling alternative to authors of scholarly works for a way of publishing their work.

The history of our work has been [documented in a website](https://leverinitiative.wordpress.com) begun when the Task Force was launched. You can find there as well copies of the results of a faculty survey we conducted about needs in scholarly publishing, and our first report to the Oberlin Group.

If you’re interested, you can read as well:

The

 that we issued to publishers inviting submissions for ways of realizing our vision;

The 

<a href="/assets/mpacpleverfinalredct.pdf">proposal submitted by the Amherst/Michigan team</a>

 that we selected;

The 

<a href="/assets/lever_press_business_plan_final_feb15-2.pdf">business plan</a>

 we agreed to together.

After finalizing our choice, the Task Force has met regularly with the Amherst/Michigan team to finalize the documents that set out how the Lever Press will be 

<a href="/assets/lever-press-mou_signed_corrected.pdf">governed by participating libraries and guided by its editorial board.</a>

 Note that while the initial agreement is between the publishing team and the Oberlin Group, participation is not limited to Oberlin Group members, and libraries committing to our work stand as equals in the governance of the Press.

We’ve also developed the document that 

<a href="/assets/lever_press_pledge_agreement_final20150923-1.pdf">participating libraries will be asked to sign</a>

 in joining the Lever Press initiative as stakeholders.
