_ASIANetwork Books_

Series editors: Erin McCarthy and Lisa Trivedi

This series publishes high-quality, original monographs embodying a rigorous liberal arts approach to Asian Studies. Manuscripts published in the ASIANetwork series, no matter how narrowly focused, are expected to raise broad questions of interest and potential classroom utility for Asian Studies scholars in the liberal arts. We encourage authors to discuss a workâ€™s pedagogical relevance when submitting their manuscript for consideration. While the ASIANetwork Series assists teachers in their own professional development and deepens the understanding of Asia within our campus communities, it is also intended to provide a broader reading public with reliable and accurate scholarship about Asia.
