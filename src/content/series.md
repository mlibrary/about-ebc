<h2 id="asianetwork"><cite>ASIANetwork Books</cite></h2>

Series editors: Erin McCarthy and Lisa Trivedi

This series publishes high-quality, original monographs embodying a rigorous liberal arts approach to Asian Studies. Manuscripts published in the _ASIANetwork_ series, no matter how narrowly focused, are expected to raise broad questions of interest and potential classroom utility for Asian Studies scholars in the liberal arts. We encourage authors to discuss a workâ€™s pedagogical relevance when submitting their manuscript for consideration. While the _ASIANetwork_ Series assists teachers in their own professional development and deepens the understanding of Asia within our campus communities, it is also intended to provide a broader reading public with reliable and accurate scholarship about Asia.



<h2 id="multimodal"><cite>Multimodal Monographs</cite></h2>

Series editor: Jason Mittell

Combining the possibilities of digital scholarship with the long-standing strengths of the print monograph, this series strives to publish works that convey ideas and expand knowledge via digital rhetorics. _Multimodal Monographs_ will resemble traditional print books as accessed via an online e-reader, but use embedded media forms such as video, audio, and high-resolution images to convey ideas that could not be sufficiently expressed in static print. The published works will explore a wide-range of topics and approaches, but be united through a commitment to born-digital publishing as structured through the stable, archivable, and library-optimized open-access Fulcrum platform, and the use of media assets as core components of intellectual expression, not just illustrations or examples.



<h2 id="re-editions"><cite>Re-Editions: Literary and cultural texts, recovered for the classroom</cite></h2>

Series editor: Michelle Burnham

The _Re-Editions_ series is dedicated to recovering forgotten or overlooked texts from archives, special collections, and the dustbins of history. Quality critical digital editions of books with the potential to change the way we imagine and teach literary and cultural history, suitable for classroom use.
