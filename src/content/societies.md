title: Information for Societies
---
As the only Ebook collection curated by scholars, for scholars, ACLS HEB depends on the [member societies of ACLS](https://acls.org/Member-Societies/Society-Profiles.aspx) to partner with us in selecting new titles and curating the collection over time. We endeavor to maintain ongoing communication with as many ACLS societies as possible, and we hope that offering discounted individual access to the collection will help learned societies better serve their independent, contingent, or otherwise precarious members. If you are a representative of a learned society and wish to become involved with selection or individual access, please contact ACLS HEBâ€™s Acquiring Editor, Sean Guynes, at [guynes@umich.edu](mailto:guynes@umich.edu).

What Can ACLS HEB Do for Learned Societies?\[header with three buttons, each with brief description]

* Access: We offer individual subscriptions to ACLS society members at the discounted price of $25/year. This is especially helpful for your members who are not affiliated with an academic library system (e.g. independent scholars, contingent faculty, etc.).Learn more about individual access. 
* Exposure: ACLS HEB can host and highlight outstanding titles in your discipline. We are especially eager to include materials that have not been digitized or are otherwise difficult to access. Learn more about the curation process here. [[link to this description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpKKuMI3oVsgG9WgubKVvNwynUoeEAcRlGwi6ikWGKg/edit?usp=sharing)]
* Innovative Partnerships: We depend upon communication with learned societies to foster innovation in academic publishing and get the most out of our [Fulcrum platform](https://fulcrum.org).
