In 2023 we were fortunate to receive support from more than 250 libraries, a level of commitment that convinced the University of Michigan's Provost Office to convert one-time into continuing funding. Thank you to the Provost and to all those institutions who showed her that there is real community support from other institutions that benefit from the open access books we publish. The top ten books by usage in 2024 were:
