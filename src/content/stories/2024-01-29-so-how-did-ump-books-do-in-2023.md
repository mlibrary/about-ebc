title: So How Did UMP Books Do in 2023?
summary: I﻿n 2022, [we reported on a year when the support of 100 libraries
  enabled UMP to publish 50% of its frontlist monographs open
  access](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/stories/2023-02-01-so-how-did-they-do-in-2022/).
  It was a risky bid because costs outstripped income. In 2023, however, we
  enlisted 100 more library supporters (so 200 in total) and not only could we
  make 75% of our frontlist OA but we feel closer to the goal of long-term
  sustainability. Thank you to [all 200 institutions who supported Fund to
  Mission](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/invest/#supporters)!
