Iï»¿n 2022, [we reported on a year when the support of 100 libraries enabled UMP to publish 50% of its frontlist monographs open access](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/stories/2023-02-01-so-how-did-they-do-in-2022/). It was a risky bid because costs outstripped income. In 2023, however, we enlisted 100 more library supporters (so 200 in total) and not only could we make 75% of our frontlist OA but we feel closer to the goal of long-term sustainability. Thank you to [all 200 institutions who supported Fund to Mission](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/invest/#supporters)! The top ten books by usage in 2023 were:

> 1. [Music on the Move](https://press.umich.edu/Books/M/Music-on-the-Move)
> 2. [Memetic Rhetorics: Toward a Toolkit for Ethical Meming](https://press.umich.edu/Books/M/Memetic-Rhetorics)
> 3. [Listening to the Lomax Archive: The Sonic Rhetorics of African American Folksong in the 1930s](https://press.umich.edu/Books/L/Listening-to-the-Lomax-Archive2)
> 4. [Brushed in Light: Calligraphy in East Asian Cinema](https://press.umich.edu/Books/B/Brushed-in-Light)
> 5. [Poetry, History, Memory: Wang Jingwei and China in Dark Times](https://press.umich.edu/Books/P/Poetry-History-Memory)
> 6. [Writing Workflows: Beyond Word Processing](https://press.umich.edu/Books/W/Writing-Workflows)
> 7. [Vidding: A History](https://press.umich.edu/Books/V/Vidding2)
> 8. [Mobilizing the Metropolis: How the Port Authority Built New York](https://press.umich.edu/Books/M/Mobilizing-the-Metropolis2)
> 9. [A Study of Crisis](https://press.umich.edu/Books/A/A-Study-of-Crisis)
> 10. [Here for the Hearing: Analyzing the Music in Musical Theater](https://press.umich.edu/Books/H/Here-for-the-Hearing2)

When looking at data from books in our ebook collection, [a study by doctoral intern Zhenkun Lin](https://blogs.lib.umich.edu/tiny-studies/visualizing-impact-university-michigan-press-fund-mission-initiative) reported a striking difference between open access and closed access titles when considering geographic reach and overall usage. Using data from the first two years of our Fund to Mission program, he found that OA books are accessed 13 times more frequently than restricted content, and OA books reach two times the number of countries when compared to restricted content. Open Access facilitates information exchange, increases global reach, elicits positive responses from readers, and is becoming a dominant mode of publishing.

Thanks to Fund to Mission, over 2.5 million readers in more than 225 countries and territories have now benefited from the high-quality information U-M Press publishes.
