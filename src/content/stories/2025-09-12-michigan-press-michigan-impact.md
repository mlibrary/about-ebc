University of Michigan Press regional titles are enjoyed and read from Houghton to Tecumseh thanks to a collaboration with the Library of Michigan called "Read Michigan" which will soon celebrate its fifth year. Launched in collaboration with the non-profit incubator Lyrasis, [readmichigan.org ](https://readmichigan.biblioboard.com)was created in collaboration with the three university presses in the State and offers over 300 of their most notable titles, providing the best sources for the culture, history, and natural history of the Mitten State. Best of all, the ebook collection is free within the geographical boundaries of the State, and can be accessed in all public library districts. 

Michigan is one of the only US states to have three university presses - and all dedicated to the public good ([University of Michigan Press](https://press.umich.edu/), [Michigan State University Press](https://msupress.org/), and [Wayne State University Press](https://wsupress.wayne.edu/)). Each has a very different profile, but all are committed to the highest quality of publication and trusted quality in an age where misinformation is rampant. Alongside regional titles, the presses publish world-leading titles in subjects ranging from political science to African studies, from classics to Jewish studies, and from performing arts to environmental policy.

This interactive map displays a representative sample of usage data collected between 2021 and 2025, totaling over 50,000 reads. While urban centers show the most usage, all of the State's 83 counties feature some use.

So, where are the most readers? Ann Arbor, Traverse City, East Lansing, Grand Rapids, Marquette? No, Redford Township, just west of Detroit. Congratulations to the [Redford Township District Library](https://www.rtdl.org/) for anchoring a community of true "bookavores."

They searched for everything from "whitefish" to "Mormon murders," from "the Battle of the River Raisin" to "Vernors." Here are the top ten University of Michigan Press books loved by residents of the best state in America (OK, we're biased):

* *[Michigan Legends: Folktales and Lore from the Great Lakes State](https://press.umich.edu/Books/M/Michigan-Legends)*, by Sheryl James
* *[Baseball Fever: Early Baseball in Michigan](https://press.umich.edu/Books/B/Baseball-Fever2)*, by Peter R. Morris
* *[Grit, Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll](https://press.umich.edu/Books/G/Grit-Noise-and-Revolution2)*, by David A. Carson
* *[The Birds of Michigan](https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/The-Birds-of-Michigan)*, by Norman Asa Wood
* *[Ancient Life of the Great Lakes](https://press.umich.edu/Books/A/Ancient-Life-of-the-Great-Lakes-Basin)*, by J. Alan Holman

Beyond the regional interest books, Michigan residents describe how University of Michigan Press open access books are touching their lives in responses to our "free ebook survey" that pops up once only when a reader benefits from one of the 1,000 books [we can make freely available online](https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan?locale=en&user_access=oa) thanks to support from the U-M Provost's Office and 250 supporting libraries. Here are some of our favorite quotes:

* This quote from a respondent in the **Upper Peninsula** illustrates how open-access pathways serve talented individuals in geographically isolated areas who lack institutional support. "I am not associated with an institution that subscribes to many of the original source research documents so I find sites such as this one invaluable. I'm also a writer about nature and use this information in my writings."
* A respondent from **Cheboygan County** describes how university scholarship can be transformed into a practical tool for regional planning and supporting "invisible" community priorities like local farming: "I'm a planner in Cheboygan County. The NE corner of the state and the UP need serious economic development help and are not getting it. This [book] can help an invisible batch of local farmers that many organizations, even those working in econ dev just do not see or purposely ignore!"
* From a participant who worked to start a farm market in **Roscommon**, this quote highlights the importance of connecting university resources to community-led initiatives that address practical needs like nutrition and economic survival: "My husband and I led the start of a wonderful farm market in Roscommon Mi. We say businesses form out of the effort and the community engagement was amazing. I am absolutely on fire to bring this to my new-to-me community. So many people either still do not have access to or know what to do with fresh food. The nutritional value of sustainably grown and small farmer produced products and the economic impact on those families is where our heart is."
* This quote from an aspiring scholar at the **Michigan/Ohio border** underscores how open access democratizes information for people with disabilities who are often excluded from traditional "ivory tower" academic structures. "I am a wannabe (i.e. 'aspiring') independent scholar; I have a disability... I find that having the possibility to consult it freely is a huge opportunity, especially in a world where academic resources are not shared as I think they should."
* A respondent from **Lansing** emphasizes how reciprocal scholarship empowers those in the field to enhance their own community-based educational practices. "Incorporating a blend of theory & practical instructional strategies, the book is meticulously designed to equip and empower Teachers and Educators to make their teaching highly creative & innovative."

We are so inspired by our readers. It makes us committed to making more Michigan books open to all, and advancing life-changing education for our neighbors.
