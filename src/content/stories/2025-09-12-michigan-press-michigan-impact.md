title: Michigan Press, Michigan Impact. Where are the State's most serious
  bookworms? A new map answers the question
summary: Readers across the State of Michigan just love reading University of
  Michigan Press books! Our interactive map shows where titles on local history,
  culture, and the environment are consumed, and no corner of the Mitten State
  remains untouched. Blame the long winters indoors or the lazy summer days on
  the many pristine freshwater beaches, but Michiganders love to read -
  especially university-produced books they know they can trust

University of Michigan Press regional titles are enjoyed and read from Houghton to Tecumseh thanks to a collaboration with the Library of Michigan called "Read Michigan" which will soon celebrate its fifth year. Launched in collaboration with the non-profit incubator Lyrasis, [readmichigan.org ](https://readmichigan.biblioboard.com)was created in collaboration with the three university presses in the State and offers over 300 of their most notable titles, providing the best sources for the culture, history, and natural history of the Mitten State. Best of all, the ebook collection is free within the geographical boundaries of the State, and can be accessed in all public library districts. 

Michigan is one of the only US states to have three university presses - and all dedicated to the public good ([University of Michigan Press](https://press.umich.edu/), [Michigan State University Press](https://msupress.org/), and [Wayne State University Press](https://wsupress.wayne.edu/)). Each has a very different profile, but all are committed to the highest quality of publication and trusted quality in an age where misinformation is rampant. Alongside regional titles, the presses publish world-leading titles in subjects ranging from political science to African studies, from classics to Jewish studies, and from performing arts to environmental policy.

This interactive map displays a representative sample of usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025. While urban centers show the most usage, there are very few of the State's 83 counties that don't show some use.
