In summer 2022, the University of Michigan Press celebrated the halfway mark of its transition to publishing new scholarly monographs open access. [Forty titles are being released with open access editions in 2022](https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan?locale=en&user_access=oa) and the target for 2023 is sixty - representing 75% of the Press's annual frontlist.

The target was achieved thanks [to a major contribution from the U-M Provost's Office](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/stories/2022-08-20-university-contributes-1-2-million-to-fund-to-mission-program/) and continuing investments in the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection[ from over 100 libraries around the world](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/invest#supporters).

> “The Fund-to-Mission program is exciting and innovative. It demonstrates the University of Michigan's commitment to scholarly knowledge creation and has made them a leader among champions of openly accessible content. This collaborative funding model brings all stakeholders - libraries, presses, authors, and university leaders - together to chart a course for sustainable scholarly monograph publishing and addresses support for the foundational infrastructure needed for academy-owned scholarly publishing. The libraries of the BTAA were early investors in Fund-to-Mission, and we are pleased to see this first phase of the vision reach fruition. We greet this as another step forward on the pathway toward creating a sustainable and scalable open knowledge ecosystem.”

said Kate McCready, Visiting Program Officer for Academy Owned Scholarly Publishing at [the Big Ten Academic Alliance](https://btaa.org/library/Libraries), congratulating the Press on a successful launch. Spanning 11 US states and 14 campuses, the universities of the Big Ten educate more than half a million students a year and spend $11.5 billion on funded research.
