A﻿ love of theater was the through-line of Herbert Kenyon's distinguished career at the University of Michigan, [culminating in the directorship of the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater at the University](https://aadl.org/aa_news_19581220_p20-kenyon_herbert). With his wife Bessie, Professor Kenyon supported the careers of hundreds of student actors and directors, at the same time as publishing distinguished articles and books on Romance languages - especially Spanish.

A﻿s well as supporting University of Michigan Library acquisitions of books on drama the Herbert A. Kenyon and Bessie W. Kenyon Fund is supporting open access publication of six important books in 2025:
