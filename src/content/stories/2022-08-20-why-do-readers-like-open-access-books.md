They come from all around the world, with a majority of individual readers from outside North America. Every day, hundreds of individual readers access University of Michigan Press open-access books and receive a gentle prompt - please fill in a few details to tell us why you were interested in this book. The request quickly disappears, but many readers - grateful for a free ebook - are happy to respond.

Based on an analysis of over 5,000 of these responses, recorded on our Fulcrum open-source platform, we've identified five key groups that benefit from open-access books:

* International readers in low-income countries

  * "I'm lucky to have access to a university library, but in a low-income country. Thanks for OA."
  * "OA books are very helpful, especially for the philosophers from Ukraine, who have few possibilities to buy new literature and to work on the modern level."
  * "As a scholar from the global south where access to scholarly literature is limited, this is a welcome gift."
  * "I'm from Algeria and, unfortunately, there is a lack of academic resources."
  * "I"m a research scholar of English literature from India. I'm thankful to the publishers and authors for this open access ebook because many books are not available globally or are too expensive."
  * "As a scholar in Mexico, I often do not have ready access to up-to-date Mexicanist scholarship in English; our university libraries have little budget for purchases or subscriptions, and personal orders often come with high shipping costs. I do make purchases, but open access materials are a great resource for scholars working across borders of all kinds."
* Students

  * "My professor mentioned this was free, and I'm so thankful as a grad student."
  * "Open Access books are so helpful for me, an online graduate student who also has a disability. I can't always get to the library, so having access to books online is so helpful."
  * "It was really nice of you to make it so easily accessible. It really helps out poor students."
  * "Thank you for giving this for free! Really helps me as a student in the course because I canâ€™t really afford to buy copies of books as a student."
  * "I am extremely grateful for making this available online. For research students like me who do not have easy access to foreign publications and are not able to afford those with our limited scholarships, this is a huge help."
  * "I learned about this book because my college is actively researching alternatives to print books, because of the expense to students."
* Interested lay readers

  * "I read purely for my own pleasure and thank you for making these texts freely available."
  * "I am a retired Italian university librarian and I write articles on wikipedia to share my knowledge, the open access documentation is precious, thank you!!"
* Independent or loosely-affiliated scholars

  * "I'm an independent researcher, and using a public library's open source archive to find this resource."
