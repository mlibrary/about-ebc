<h2 id="oa">Open Access</h2>

In the humanities, the monograph acts as the lab where scholars experiment and engage with other thinkers. Despite the valuable ideas emerging from these fields, the academic community has struggled to find sustainable ways to make humanities monographs open access. Grant money and other funding is often less available to these scholars than to their counterparts in the sciences. As a result, the academic and publishing communities have had to explore new ways to make the turn to open. Fund to Mission from the University of Michigan Press is one such project to open up the best humanities scholarship to the global community.

The endeavor of opening humanities content to the world is a vital one. As the core places where work in these fields is done, monographs have the potential to be spaces that inspire dialogues and connections. When monographs exist only behind paywalls, there is less of an opportunity for global collaborations to happen. However, when these monographs become open access, new opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange emerge.

The University of Michigan Press has moved towards open access for its monographs precisely in order to provide these new opportunities for exploration. Ensuring that everyone has access to this scholarship, no matter where they are located or what their institutional affiliation is, can only strengthen the humanities.

<h2 id="model">Overview of Fund to Mission Open Access Model</h2>

Working with LYRASIS, the University of Michigan has been taking steps to develop a publishing program that aligns with our mission and commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. In the spring of 2021, the Press announced its transition to an open access monograph model termed Fund to Mission. 

Fund to Mission demonstrates a return to <a href="https://aupresses.org/the-value-of-university-presses/">the origins of the university press movement</a> and moves toward a more open, sustainable infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Our goal is to convert at least 75% of U-M Press monographs to open access by the end of 2023, <b>without any author ever having to pay</b>.

### The Funding Model

Libraries are invited to continue to participate in the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC) by way of our current fair pricing. However, rather than only funding a paywalled collection, an increasing percentage of titles become open access. By committing to purchase one of the UMP EBC packages (listed under "Investment Options"), libraries:

* Support the conversion to open access of at least half (~40) of University of Michigan Press scholarly monographs in 2022. (If we realize our goal, we will expand this percentage in succeeding years.);
* Receive perpetual access to the remaining restricted frontlist titles and term access to the backlist (~1,700 titles), which will otherwise remain closed to non-purchasers;
* Support authors’ ability to publish innovative, digital scholarship leveraging the next-generation, open-source Fulcrum platform.

### The Mission

With Fund to Mission, we are asking for shared investment in strengthening humanities and social sciences infrastructure and scholarship. Through a transparent model that fits with existing library workflows and provides unique benefits to supporters, we hope to:

* Expand inclusive, equitable access to high-quality humanities and qualitative social science scholarship for diverse, global audiences;
* Increase the number of accessible, open learning resources for students that are instantly available, downloadable, and free of DRM restrictions;
* Expand the demonstrated opportunity for increased visibility and impact that open access provides to all authors, without the inequities of “pay to publish”;
* Demonstrate support for a non-profit infrastructure and sustainable business model, on a platform that already hosts other university press content and collections;
* Inspire the leaders of parent institutions to financially support their presses in more sustainable and open approaches to monograph publishing.

#### What We Do With the Money

In 2020 we worked with consultant Kimberly Schmelzinger to do a detailed analysis of the cost of just the Press’s specialist monograph program. The total cost of producing 80 books a year came to $1,650,000, and that meant that in order to make those titles open access, we would need to find that amount of financial support. With Fund to Mission, that money comes from three main pools: the University of Michigan Provost, author and funding institutions, and library investments. We anticipate that some print sales will still occur regardless of a monograph’s open access status, and this will help fill in the funding gap.

Our current goal is to receive $400,000 in continuing support from libraries for Fund to Mission. The money given to the Fund to Mission program goes to support the transition of the monograph program at the University of Michigan Press to open access.

* Approximately 15% of the money from the Fund to Mission program goes to the non-profit incubator LYRASIS to support their efforts in publicizing and managing the institutional side of the program.
* Another 15% of the funding goes to pay for Fulcrum, our hosting platform.
* Because some monographs in the collection remain restricted access, royalties must be paid on those titles.
* The rest of the money goes back into the program for editing, production, design work, and marketing.

Once the 2021 collection year has closed we are excited to share a thorough breakdown of how the money was spent.

Those percentages mean that, at least in the near future, some monographs will be restricted access. The decision of which titles to open and which to restrict is based on multiple considerations.

* When determining whether or not a title will be open access we first appraise the potential impact of the scholarship and the benefit to broader society of making it widely and freely available. Issues regarding diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility are cornerstones in our strategic mission and play a role in our decision-making process. We also use our knowledge of the subject area of a given title. How friendly is the field to open access? Will publishing the title open access make it ineligible for the major reviews and awards in the field?
* Our next step involves having a conversation with the author. We share information about how making monographs open access increases their readership and impact globally, and we discuss concerns the author may have, including their own perception of OA in their field, whether or not tenure standards at their institution consider OA material to be qualifying scholarly contributions, their relationship to royalties, and numerous other factors.
* If we think that a title is a good candidate for open access and the author agrees with us, then we move forward with our standard monograph peer review, editorial, production, and marketing processes. We believe that opening scholarship does not mean decreasing publication standards. Rather, open access is simply a different, more equitable, funding model that deepens global conversations and enables monographs to have a larger impact.
* By opening our content and showing that monographs increase their usage, reach, and accolades by being open, we hope to encourage more scholars to pursue open access scholarship in the future.

<h2 id="partnergroup">Library Partner Group</h2>

The University of Michigan Press has created a Library Partner Group as part of our efforts to engage with the needs of the library community and the complexity of the open access landscape. 

The purpose of the Library Partner Group is to provide the University of Michigan Press with feedback and advice regarding product strategy and the advancement of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. We see this as a Community of Practice more than the traditional Advisory Group.

We hope to receive feedback on all aspects of the open access lifecycle, from technical and metadata concerns to the difficulties of access and how to ensure that our approach to open access reflects our commitment to DEIA. In particular, we want to use the input from this group to continue to improve our approach to opening humanities and social sciences books with Fund to Mission.

The group is made up of [UMP library supporters](https://ebc.press.umich.edu/invest/#supporters). The Library Partner Group is led by Emma Vecellio, Library Relations Manager for U-M Press, who maintains the group email listserv, develops meeting agendas, leads discussions, and outlines group action items in an effort to help drive development. 

#### **How the group works**

With the exception of University of Michigan Press staff, the group will be limited to library staff members of supporting institutions of the University of Michigan Press Ebook collection.  

Library Partner Group members commit to attend all meetings via Zoom. Meetings will be held twice a year. The time and date will be determined by the facilitator via Doodle Poll. Members are welcome to invite colleagues to join Partner Group meetings.

Notes and a recording will be circulated by the facilitator after each call, and any members who were unable to attend a call are asked to ensure they read these and take note of any action items.

The facilitator will also maintain a listserv group. The listserv will be used to communicate information about meetings and will also be used to share updates and engage with more immediate topics or questions in between the bi-annual meetings.

If you have questions, please email [ump-ebc-info@umich.edu](mailto:ump-ebc-info@umich.edu).
