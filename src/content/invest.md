<h2 id="oa">Open Access</h2>

<h2 id="model">Overview of OA Model</h2>

Working with LYRASIS, the University of Michigan has been taking steps to develop a publishing program that aligns with our mission and commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. In the spring of 2021, the Press announced it is transitioning to an open access monograph model termed Fund to Mission. 

Fund to Mission demonstrates a return to <a href="https://aupresses.org/the-value-of-university-presses/">the origins of the university press movement</a> and moves toward a more open, sustainable infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Our goal is to convert at least 75% of U-M Press monographs to open access by the end of 2023, <b>without any author ever having to pay</b>.

### The Funding Model

Libraries are invited to continue to participate in the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC) by way of our current fair pricing. However, rather than only funding a paywalled collection, an increasing percentage of titles become open access. By committing to purchase one of the UMP EBC packages (listed below), libraries:

- Support the conversion to open access of at least half (~40) of University of Michigan Press scholarly monographs in 2022. (We will expand this percentage if we realize our full goal, and will build on itin succeeding years);
- Receive perpetual access to the remaining restricted frontlist titles and term access to the backlist(~1,700 titles), which will otherwise remain closed to non-purchasers;
- Support authorsâ€™ ability to publish innovative, digital scholarship leveraging the next-generation,open-source Fulcrum platform.

### Investment Options

#### 2021-2023 Transitional Collection

Upfront purchase of the 2021, 2022, and 2023 frontlists (the OA percentage of which will be determined based on funding, but with a goal of at least 50% per year in 2022 and 2023). Libraries will own the restricted titles in perpetuity as they become available and will have term access to the backlist through 2023.
